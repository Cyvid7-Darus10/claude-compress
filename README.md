# claude-savings

**Claude re-reads the same files 2-5 times per session. Every re-read dumps the full file into context again — pure waste.**

We measured 107 real sessions: 68 exact duplicate reads wasting ~99k tokens/week, on top of ~264k tokens/week from verbose output. No other tool blocks duplicate reads — we intercept them **before they happen** via a PreToolUse hook.

claude-savings is a two-hook system for Claude Code: a PreToolUse hook that blocks duplicate reads, and a PostToolUse hook for output compression and loop detection. Two files, zero dependencies, ~363k tokens saved per week — measured, not estimated.

## Real impact

Measured from 107 real Claude Code sessions on a single machine (7 days). If you code across multiple machines, your savings scale proportionally — install the hook on each one.

## Three savings strategies

### 1. Duplicate Read blocking — the big one (~316k tokens/week)

Claude re-reads files it already has in context — same file, same parameters, 2-5 times per session. We measured **68 exact duplicate reads per week** across 107 sessions, wasting ~99k tokens. Each one re-adds the full file to the conversation for no reason.

Other tools warn about this. We **block it**.

```
  Claude tries to Read src/auth.ts (already read 40 turns ago)
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  BLOCKED by claude-savings                           │
  │                                                      │
  │  src/auth.ts was already read in this session with   │
  │  the same parameters. The file content is already    │
  │  in your conversation context — scroll up to find    │
  │  it.                                                 │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  → Zero tokens wasted. Claude uses the content already in context.
```

How it works:
- **PreToolUse hook** intercepts Read calls before they execute
- Tracks which files were read per session (with offset/limit params)
- Exact same read = **blocked** with `decision: "block"`
- Different offset/limit = allowed (intentional partial re-reads)
- State stored in `~/.claude-savings/read-cache.json`

Real examples from measured sessions — files Claude re-read for no reason:

```
  Read 5x   4k    dashboard/index.html        (3,684 tokens wasted)
  Read 4x   5k    BrandingSection.tsx          (4,041 tokens wasted)
  Read 3x   18k   AboutSection.tsx             (8,868 tokens wasted)
  Read 3x   10k   README.md                    (4,874 tokens wasted)
  Read 2x   29k   leads/page.tsx               (7,160 tokens wasted)
  Read 2x   15k   Navbar.tsx                   (3,822 tokens wasted)
```

These are exact duplicates — same file, same parameters, same content re-added to context.

> **Why not compress Read output instead?** We tested it. 94% of edits to large files target the middle — exactly the part compression would strip. Compressing Read would cause Claude to hallucinate or fail on nearly every edit. We measured this against 316 real Read→Edit sequences. Blocking duplicates is the right approach — it saves the same tokens without breaking anything.

### 2. Output compression (77% average reduction, ~264k tokens/week)

PostToolUse hook that compresses verbose output from Bash, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, and WebSearch:

| Tool | Strategy | What's kept | What's stripped |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bash** | Strip noise, collapse stack traces | Errors, warnings, app-level frames | Progress bars, repeated lines, node_modules frames |
| **Grep** | Truncate matches | First 15 + last 5, total count | Excess matches beyond 30 |
| **Glob** | Truncate file lists | First 20 files, total count | Excess files beyond 30 |
| **WebFetch** | Strip HTML, truncate | Text content, head + tail | `<script>`, `<style>`, HTML tags |
| **WebSearch** | Truncate results | First 30 results | Excess results |

Smart stack trace handling — collapses `node_modules` and `internal/` frames:

```
  Before (30 lines):                 After (5 lines):
  TypeError: Cannot read 'id'       TypeError: Cannot read 'id'
    at getUserProfile (users.ts:47)    at getUserProfile (users.ts:47)
    at processAuth (auth.ts:12)        at processAuth (auth.ts:12)
    at Layer.handle (node_modules/     (+ 28 framework frames hidden)
      express/lib/router/layer.js)   Process exited with code 1
    ... 25 more node_modules lines
  Process exited with code 1
```

### 3. Loop detection (prevents 10-50k tokens per incident)

Detects when Claude repeats the same tool call 3+ times with identical input and output:

```
  [savings: LOOP DETECTED] "npm test" has produced the same result 3 times.
  This is wasting tokens. Stop and try a different approach.
```

Rare in normal usage (0 times in our 107-session benchmark), but when it fires it prevents the worst token waste — Claude retrying a command that will never succeed.

## Cost savings

### Per developer

| Model | Tokens saved/month | Cost saved/month |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | ~1.45M | **$4.36** |
| Claude Opus 4.6 | ~1.45M | **$21.78** |

### At scale

| Team size | Model | Cost saved/month | Cost saved/year |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 devs | Sonnet | $44 | **$523** |
| 10 devs | Opus | $218 | **$2,614** |
| 50 devs | Opus | $1,089 | **$13,068** |
| 200 devs | Opus | $4,356 | **$52,272** |

> Based on measured data from a single machine: ~363k tokens saved per week (264k from compression + 99k from blocked duplicate reads). Developers working across multiple machines will see proportionally higher savings — install on each machine and run `node benchmark.mjs` to measure.

### How this makes Claude Code faster

Less context = faster responses. Every token saved from a duplicate read or compressed output is one fewer token re-processed on every subsequent turn:

```
  Turn 5:  Claude reads auth.ts (4,000 chars / 1,000 tokens)
  Turn 30: Claude tries to re-read auth.ts
           → BLOCKED. Zero tokens added.
           Without blocking: 1,000 tokens × 50 remaining turns = 50,000 tokens wasted
```

Effects:
- **Faster time-to-first-token** — less input per turn
- **Delayed compaction** — sessions last longer before Claude "forgets" earlier work
- **Better prompt cache hits** — stable context = more cache reuse (10x cheaper)
- **Lower rate limit pressure** — fewer tokens per request

## Why this over alternatives

| | claude-savings | [contextzip](https://github.com/jee599/contextzip) | [clauditor](https://github.com/IyadhKhalfallah/clauditor) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Blocks duplicate reads** | **Yes (PreToolUse)** | No | No |
| **Output compression** | Bash, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch | CLI output only | Bash output only |
| **Loop detection** | Yes (3+ identical calls) | No | Yes (Stop hook) |
| **Stack trace dedup** | Collapses framework frames | Collapses framework frames | No |
| **Install** | Copy 2 files | `npx` or `cargo install` | `npm install -g` |
| **Dependencies** | None | Rust binary + `jq` | 5 npm packages |
| **Size** | 2 files, ~350 lines | Full CLI + 6 filters | 31 files, TUI, daemon |

**Our edge:** We're the only tool that blocks duplicate reads via PreToolUse — preventing ~99k tokens/week of waste that other tools don't even detect. Combined with output compression (~264k tokens/week), this gives the most comprehensive token savings in one install.

## Install

```bash
# One-line install
