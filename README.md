# claude-bash-compress

A lightweight Claude Code hook that compresses verbose bash output to save context window tokens.

Every time Claude runs a bash command, the full output is added to the conversation context. A single `npm install` can dump 3,000+ characters of noise. Over a session with many tool calls, this bloat adds up — wasting tokens on progress bars, repeated lines, and install logs instead of your actual work.

This hook intercepts bash output and compresses it before it reaches the context window.

## Before & after

```
Without hook:        npm install → 2,800 chars in context
With bash-compress:  npm install →   400 chars in context (86% reduction)
```

## Why this exists

There are other tools in this space. Here's how they compare:

| | claude-bash-compress | [contextzip](https://github.com/jee599/contextzip) | [clauditor](https://github.com/IyadhKhalfallah/clauditor) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Install** | Copy 1 file | `npx` or `cargo install` | `npm install -g` + `clauditor install` |
| **Dependencies** | None (just Node.js) | Rust binary + `jq` | 5 npm packages |
| **Size** | 1 file, 120 lines | Full CLI + 6 filters | 31 source files, TUI, daemon |
| **Scope** | Bash output only | All CLI output | Session rotation, cache health, loop detection, bash compression |
| **Overhead** | Fires only on Bash (`matcher: "Bash"`) | Wraps every command | PostToolUse on every tool call |
| **Config** | Zero | Zero | Calibration system |

**Our edge: simplicity.**

- **One file.** No build step, no compiled binary, no package manager. `curl` it and add 5 lines of JSON. Done in 30 seconds.
- **Bash-only matcher.** Other tools fire on every tool call. This hook uses `matcher: "Bash"` so Read, Edit, Write, Grep calls have zero added latency.
- **No runtime dependencies.** Works with the Node.js that Claude Code already requires. No `jq`, no Rust toolchain, no global npm packages.
- **Plays well with others.** If you already run hooks (monitoring, mission control, Vercel plugin), adding a heavyweight tool creates conflicts and overhead. This hook is one more entry in your PostToolUse array — nothing else changes.
- **Forkable.** 120 lines of readable JavaScript. Want to change the compression threshold or add a custom filter? Edit one file. No framework to learn.

Use **contextzip** if you want a polished CLI with benchmarked filters for all output types. Use **clauditor** if you want full session management (rotation, cache monitoring, handoffs). Use **claude-bash-compress** if you want bash compression with nothing else in the way.

## Token savings & cost impact

Measured from a real developer's Claude Code sessions (107 sessions over 7 days):

```
  Tool results scanned:       6,023
  Short output (< 500 chars): 4,284 (passed through unchanged)
  Compressible outputs:       926
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Original total:             5,202k chars
  Compressed total:           1,049k chars
  Reduction:                  79.8%
  Tokens saved per week:      ~1,038,000
```

Run the benchmark on your own sessions to see your numbers:

```bash
node benchmark.mjs
```

### What that means in dollars

| Model | Input cost/1M tokens | Savings per dev/day | Savings per dev/month | 10-person team/month |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | $3.00 | $0.06 | $1.20 | **$12** |
| Claude Opus 4.6 | $15.00 | $0.30 | $6.00 | **$60** |
| Claude Opus 4.6 (heavy use) | $15.00 | $0.90 | $18.00 | **$180** |

The direct dollar savings are modest — the real value is **context window longevity**:

- **Fewer compactions.** Noisy bash output fills the context window faster, triggering auto-compaction that erases older context. With compression, sessions last longer before Claude "forgets" earlier work.
- **Better cache hit rates.** Smaller tool outputs mean less cache churn. Claude Code's prompt caching works better when context grows predictably.
- **Longer productive sessions.** On Sonnet (200k context), a session with 40 verbose bash calls adds ~60k tokens of noise — that's 30% of the window wasted on npm install logs. Compression recovers most of that.

### How this makes Claude Code faster

This hook doesn't make Claude's model inference faster — that's determined by Anthropic's servers. What it does is reduce the number of tokens Claude has to **re-process on every subsequent turn**.

Claude Code re-sends the **entire conversation history** on every turn. A verbose bash output from turn 5 is still being processed at turn 50:

```
  Turn 5:  npm install dumps 3,000 chars (750 tokens) into context
  Turn 6:  Claude re-processes those 750 tokens
  Turn 7:  And again
  ...
  Turn 50: Still processing those same 750 tokens — for the 45th time

  With compression (3,000 → 400 chars, saving 650 tokens):
  650 tokens × 45 remaining turns = 29,250 tokens NOT re-processed
```

Across a session with 15 verbose bash calls, that's **~400k fewer cumulative tokens processed**. Four concrete effects:

1. **Faster time-to-first-token.** Less input to process before Claude starts responding. Not dramatic per-turn (~100-300ms), but noticeable in long sessions.

2. **Lower chance of hitting rate limits.** Fewer tokens per request means more headroom before Anthropic throttles you.

3. **Delayed compaction.** Sessions last longer before auto-compaction erases older context. On Sonnet (200k window), 15 verbose bash calls add ~40k tokens of noise — that's 20% of the window wasted on install logs. Compression recovers most of it.

4. **Better prompt cache hit rates.** Claude Code uses prompt caching — repeated context is read from cache (10x cheaper) instead of reprocessed. Smaller, more stable context = more cache hits. Large bash output insertions cause cache misses that cascade through subsequent turns.

```
  Build-heavy session (50 bash calls, 100 turns):
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Without compression:
    Cumulative bash noise:     ~50k tokens in context by turn 100
    Tokens re-processed:       ~2.5M extra tokens over the session
    Cache disruptions:         ~15 (each verbose output shifts cache boundaries)

  With bash-compress:
    Cumulative bash noise:     ~12k tokens (76% less)
    Tokens re-processed:       ~600k extra tokens (saved ~1.9M)
    Cache disruptions:         ~3 (most output stays under cache threshold)
```

The speed improvement compounds. By turn 100 of a build-heavy session, you could be processing 30-50k fewer tokens per turn — that's measurably faster response times and significantly better cache economics.

### Enterprise scale

For teams on Anthropic's API (not the Pro/Max subscription), the savings compound:

| Team size | Model | Tokens saved/month | Cost saved/month | Cost saved/year |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 devs | Sonnet | 4M | $12 | **$144** |
| 10 devs | Opus | 4M | $60 | **$720** |
| 50 devs | Sonnet | 20M | $60 | **$720** |
| 50 devs | Opus | 20M | $300 | **$3,600** |
| 200 devs | Sonnet | 80M | $240 | **$2,880** |
| 200 devs | Opus | 80M | $1,200 | **$14,400** |
| 500 devs | Opus (heavy) | 600M | $9,000 | **$108,000** |

> These are conservative estimates based on ~4k tokens saved per session, 5 sessions/dev/day, 20 workdays/month. Heavy-use teams running 10+ sessions/day with frequent builds and deploys save 3-5x more.

But the dollar savings are just part of the story. The bigger wins at enterprise scale:

- **Fewer session restarts.** Devs lose 5-10 minutes of context switching each time a session runs out of context window. Across 200 devs, that's 50+ hours/month of productivity recovered.
- **Reduced compaction amnesia.** When Claude auto-compacts, it forgets earlier decisions. Less context bloat = fewer compactions = better continuity across long tasks.
- **Predictable API costs.** Token usage becomes more stable when bash noise is eliminated, making budget forecasting easier.

## What it compresses

- **Package manager output** (npm/pnpm/yarn install) → head + tail + summary
- **Progress bars** (`[=====>   ]`, `████░░`) → stripped entirely
- **Repeated lines** (50x "processing chunk") → collapsed to 1 line + count
- **Build logs** → keeps error/warn/fail lines, omits noise
- **Any output >2,000 chars** → truncated with head/tail preserved

What it **preserves**:
- Error messages, warnings, failures, exceptions
- Short output (<500 chars) passes through unchanged
- Non-Bash tool output is never touched

## Install

```bash
# 1. Copy the hook
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
curl -o ~/.claude/hooks/bash-compress.mjs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyvid7-Darus10/claude-bash-compress/main/bash-compress.mjs

# 2. Add to ~/.claude/settings.json under "hooks"
```

Add this to your `hooks.PostToolUse` array in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node \"$HOME/.claude/hooks/bash-compress.mjs\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Or use the one-line installer:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyvid7-Darus10/claude-bash-compress/main/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. No dependencies, no build step, no daemon. One file, zero config.

Requires Node.js 20+.

## How it works

Claude Code's [PostToolUse hook](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) fires after every tool call. This hook:

1. Reads the tool result from stdin (JSON with `tool_name` and `tool_response`)
2. If it's not a Bash call or the output is short, returns `{}` (no-op)
3. Otherwise, compresses the output and returns `{ additionalContext: "..." }`
4. Claude sees the compressed version alongside the original

The `matcher: "Bash"` config ensures it only runs for Bash tool calls — zero overhead on Read, Edit, Write, Grep, etc.
