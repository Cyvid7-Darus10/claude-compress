# claude-savings

A lightweight Claude Code hook that saves tokens through output compression, loop detection, and duplicate read prevention.

Every tool result stays in the conversation forever. Verbose build logs, duplicate file reads, repeated failing commands — all waste tokens that could be spent on actual work. This hook catches all three automatically.

## Real impact

Measured from 107 real Claude Code sessions (7 days):

```
  SAVINGS BREAKDOWN
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Strategy              Instances    Tokens saved/week
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Output compression        287          ~264,000
  Duplicate read warnings   309          ~316,000
  Loop detection              —          (insurance)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL                                  ~580,000
  Per month                           ~2,317,000
```

Duplicate reads are the #1 waste — Claude re-reading files already in context adds the full file content to the conversation a second time. This happens ~309 times per week in normal usage.

Run the benchmark on your own sessions:

```bash
node benchmark.mjs
```

## Three savings strategies

### 1. Output compression (77% average reduction)

Compresses verbose output from Bash, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, and WebSearch with per-tool strategies:

| Tool | Strategy | What's kept | What's stripped |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bash** | Strip noise, collapse stack traces | Errors, warnings, app-level frames | Progress bars, repeated lines, node_modules frames |
| **Grep** | Truncate matches | First 15 + last 5 matches, total count | Excess matches beyond 30 |
| **Glob** | Truncate file lists | First 20 files, total count | Excess files beyond 30 |
| **WebFetch** | Strip HTML, truncate | Text content, first 20 + last 10 lines | `<script>`, `<style>`, HTML tags |
| **WebSearch** | Truncate results | First 30 results | Excess results |

Smart stack trace handling — collapses `node_modules` and `internal/` frames while keeping your application frames:

```
  Before (30 lines):                 After (5 lines):
  TypeError: Cannot read 'id'       TypeError: Cannot read 'id'
    at getUserProfile (users.ts:47)    at getUserProfile (users.ts:47)
    at processAuth (auth.ts:12)        at processAuth (auth.ts:12)
    at Layer.handle (node_modules/     (+ 28 framework frames hidden)
      express/lib/router/layer.js)   Process exited with code 1
    ... 25 more node_modules lines
    ... 3 internal/modules lines
  Process exited with code 1
```

### 2. Duplicate Read detection (~316k tokens/week saved)

Tracks which files Claude has read in each session. When Claude re-reads a file it already has in context, the hook injects a warning:

```
  [savings: DUPLICATE READ] src/auth.ts was already read in this session
  (4.2k chars re-added to context). The file content is already in your
  conversation history. Use Read with offset/limit instead.
```

This warns only once per file (not on 3rd, 4th read) to avoid nagging.

> **Why not compress Read output?** We tested it. 94% of edits to large files target the middle — exactly the part that would be stripped. Compressing Read would cause Claude to hallucinate or fail on nearly every edit. We measured this against 316 real Read→Edit sequences.

### 3. Loop detection (prevents 10-50k tokens per incident)

Detects when Claude repeats the same tool call 3+ times with identical input and output — a sign it's stuck in a retry loop:

```
  [savings: LOOP DETECTED] "npm test" has produced the same result 3 times.
  This is wasting tokens. Stop and try a different approach.
```

Doesn't fire often in normal usage (0 times in our 107-session benchmark), but when it does fire, it prevents the worst token waste — Claude burning through thousands of tokens retrying a command that will never succeed.

## Cost savings

### Per developer

| Model | Tokens saved/month | Cost saved/month |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | ~2.3M | **$6.95** |
| Claude Opus 4.6 | ~2.3M | **$34.76** |

### At scale

| Team size | Model | Cost saved/month | Cost saved/year |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 devs | Sonnet | $70 | **$834** |
| 10 devs | Opus | $348 | **$4,171** |
| 50 devs | Opus | $1,738 | **$20,856** |
| 200 devs | Opus | $6,952 | **$83,424** |

> Based on measured data: ~580k tokens saved per dev per week (264k from compression + 316k from duplicate read prevention).

### How this makes Claude Code faster

This hook doesn't speed up Claude's inference — it reduces the tokens Claude re-processes every turn:

```
  Turn 5:  Bash dumps 3,000 chars (750 tokens) into context
  Turn 50: Still re-processing those 750 tokens — for the 45th time

  With compression (3,000 → 400 chars):
  Saved: 650 tokens × 45 remaining turns = 29,250 tokens NOT re-processed
```

Effects:
- **Faster time-to-first-token** — less input per turn
- **Delayed compaction** — sessions last longer before Claude "forgets" earlier work
- **Better prompt cache hits** — stable context = more cache reuse (10x cheaper)
- **Lower rate limit pressure** — fewer tokens per request

## Why this over alternatives

| | claude-savings | [contextzip](https://github.com/jee599/contextzip) | [clauditor](https://github.com/IyadhKhalfallah/clauditor) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strategies** | Compression + loop detection + dup read prevention | CLI output compression only | Session rotation + cache monitoring |
| **Compresses** | Bash, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch | CLI output only | Bash output only |
| **Loop detection** | Yes (3+ identical calls) | No | Yes (Stop hook) |
| **Duplicate reads** | Yes (warns on re-reads) | No | No |
| **Stack traces** | Collapses framework frames | Collapses framework frames | No |
| **Install** | Copy 1 file | `npx` or `cargo install` | `npm install -g` |
| **Dependencies** | None | Rust binary + `jq` | 5 npm packages |
| **Size** | 1 file, 280 lines | Full CLI + 6 filters | 31 files, TUI, daemon |

> **Why not compress Read output?** We tested it — 94% of edits target the middle of files. Compressing Read would break Claude's ability to edit code. We warn on duplicate reads instead.

## Install

```bash
# One-line install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyvid7-Darus10/claude-savings/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
curl -o ~/.claude/hooks/compress.mjs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyvid7-Darus10/claude-savings/main/compress.mjs
```

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node \"$HOME/.claude/hooks/compress.mjs\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

No dependencies, no build step. Requires Node.js 20+.

## Configuration

Edit the constants at the top of `compress.mjs`:

| Constant | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_CHARS` | 2000 | Maximum compressed output size |
| `MIN_CHARS` | 500 | Output shorter than this passes through unchanged |
| `LOOP_THRESHOLD` | 3 | Identical calls before loop warning |
| `SKIP_COMPRESS` | Read, Edit, Write, Agent, ... | Tools that are never compressed |

State files are stored in `~/.claude-savings/` (loop counts and read history per session).
